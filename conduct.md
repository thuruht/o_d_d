# O.D.D.Map Community Philosophy

This project is built by and for a global community of travelers. We have three guiding principles that we ask everyone to share.

### 1. Be Kind
This is the most important rule. Treat fellow users, contributors, and the people you meet on your travels with respect, patience, and empathy. We are all here to share knowledge and help each other explore the world. There is a zero-tolerance policy for harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.

### 2. Respect the Place
Every point on this map is someone's home. Be considerate of local communities, their customs, and their way of life. Ask for permission before camping on private land, support local businesses, and always be a good ambassador for the overlanding community. The data we collect should never facilitate disrespect or violating the wishes of local people.

### 3. Leave It Better
We have a shared responsibility to protect the natural environments we travel through. This means packing out all waste, respecting wildlife, and only using designated fire pits when and where it's safe. Do not add places to this map that would encourage environmental damage.

This is a community-moderated project. We trust you to contribute responsibly and help us by reporting any content that does not align with these principles. Thank you for being a positive part of our community.
