# A Guide to Great Contributions

Thank you for helping our community grow! This map is built by travelers like you. Here are a few quick tips to make your contributions awesome.

### What We Love to See

* **Honest, detailed descriptions.** The best tips come from personal experience. Tell us *why* a place was special. Was the view incredible? Did the mechanic have the right part? Was it just a peaceful spot to have lunch? Your story is what makes a location useful.

* **Helpful photos.** A picture of the campsite, the storefront, or the view is perfect. A picture of your smiling face is also great, but maybe not as the primary photo for the location!

* **Unique and useful spots.** We especially love those hard-to-find placesâ€”a remote water source, a great wild camping spot, or a shop with rare supplies.

* **Spontaneous joys!** Feel free to add that **Scenic Viewpoint** you stopped at for five minutes or that perfect **Day Use / Picnic Area**. Not every great spot is an overnight stay.

### Our Core Principle: Be a Good Traveler

The most important rule is to be respectful. That means respecting the **environment** (leave no trace!), **local communities** (be a good guest!), and **each other** (be kind!).

Please don't add any places that are illegal, on private property without permission, or would encourage others to do harm.

That's it! Thank you for sharing your journey with us.
